# Description

AutomationServiceHandler is a Revit addin that allows users to run and debug their Revit Automation application locally using desktop Revit. 

# Demonstration

See [step-by-step video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0LJ9JOpKMQ)

# Setup

## Prerequisites

1. **APS Account**: Learn how to create a APS Account, activate your subscription, and create an app at [this tutorial](http://aps.autodesk.com/tutorials/#/account/). 
2. **Visual Studio**: [2022 or newer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
3. **.NET Framework** or **.NET Core** basic knowledge with C#
4. **Revit**: required for compiling plugin changes

## Compile and Load on Revit

1. Build the solution `AutomationServiceHandler`, compiling AutomationServiceHandler for Revit 2023 (`AutomationServiceHandler2023`), Revit 2024 (`AutomationServiceHandler2024`), Revit 2025 (`AutomationServiceHandler2025`), and Revit 2026 (`AutomationServiceHandler2026`)
    > Revit Automation API currently supports Revit 2023. 2024, 2025 and 2026.

2. Copy/paste the `AutomationServiceHandler.addin` into the "Addins" folder `C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\XXXX\`, where `XXXX` is the Revit version (e.g. 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026) you intend to run.

    > **Note.** Currently, we remained old brand name in the name of assembly and *.addin file during the transition period. Will change them in the future.

    > The assembly name is still `DesignAutomationHandler.dll` and hasn't migrated to `AutomationServiceHandler.dll`.

    > The addin filename is still `DesignAutomationHandler.addin` and hasn't migrated to `AutomationServiceHandler.addin`.

3. Copy/paste the `.addin` file of your Revit Automation plugin into the same folder `C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\XXXX\`. 

    > AutomationServiceHandler doesn't support local testing/debugging of more than one addin at a time.

    > Revit needs the `DesignAutomationBridge.dll` to be in the same folder as your addin's dlls.

## Usage

Starting Revit:

- If your addin requires an input Revit model at startup, then open the file in Revit before running the addin or specify the file using a startup argument.

    > If you have json parameter defined to run the `WorkItem` in Automation Service, you can save the json payload as a json file in the same folder as your input Revit file.

    > For example: if `CountItParams` is the name of the parameter defined in your `Activity` of the Automation Service, then you should create a file `CountItParams.json` with contents `{"walls": false,"floors": true,"doors": true,"windows": true}` and save it to the folder which contains your input Revit model.

- In the Revit ribbon, navigate to the `Add-Ins` tab, then click `External Tools`, and click the `AutomationServiceHandler` command. Your addin will by executed! A dialog will pop-up to report the execution result. If the execution was successful, the dialog will indicate where you can find the output(s). They go to the folder which contained your input files. 

- If your plugin doesn't require any input files, start Revit and run the `AutomationServiceHandler` command without any additional setup. If you have json parameter defined to run the `WorkItem` in Automation Service, a dialog will instruct you where to put your json file.  

    > You can rerun the same addin without restarting Revit.

    > To run different addin, repeat the setup steps above.

    > Currently, the AutomationServiceHandler doesn't support multiple input files.  (This feature is supported by Automation Service on APS.)
